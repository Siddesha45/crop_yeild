# Crop Yield Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict crop yields based on various environmental and agricultural factors using a machine learning model. The application is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications.

## Features
- **Data Input**: Users can input soil pH, temperature, humidity, and fertilizer amount.
- **Model Prediction**: The application uses a linear regression model to predict crop yield based on the input data.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Predictions are made in real-time as users input their data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop_yield_prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bashCopy
cd crop_yield_prediction
Install the required dependencies:
bashCopy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the crop_yield_data.csv file in the project directory. If not, you can generate it using the provided script or replace it with your own dataset.
Running the Application
Run the Streamlit application:
bashCopy
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).
